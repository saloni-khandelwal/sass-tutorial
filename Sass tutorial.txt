CSS with Superpowers
Uses language SCSS
Compile with VS Code extention Live Sass Compiler - it will create a file with compiles scss code to pure CSS

- Variables: Define variables with $. Compiled CSS file will have actual values

- Maps: Maps are property value pairs, you define a map and you can get the value through the name you define in the map

- Define nested formatting: Basically what we achieve with child and descendent selectors, you do that without having to worry about selectors - you do it in folder format

- Partial SCSS: Create _name.scss files which the compiler understands to be partial and does not compile as css files. They can be @import into regular files. Help modularise code and work on individual components.

- Functions: @function func_name ($var_name) {  @return map-get ()} Takes variables and returns values.

- Mixins: Are like functions. You basically set a name for a piece of code that you have to reuse again and again. Basically rather than creating a class and reusing it in HTML, you create a mixin and reuse it in css itself. Mix- IFin defines styles.

- Can use 'if' statements in mixin

- Extend: You can extend or copy the properties of one class to another, then change a couple of things

- Operations: You can directly use operations like + / - / multiply, like calc() in css.
